## Demo Flow

1. **App Launch**: 
   - "Camera is active. Swipe up to hear surroundings. Swipe right to ask a question."

2. **Scene Description** (Swipe Up):
   - Camera captures â†’ YOLO detects objects â†’ BLIP describes scene
   - "A person is standing near a car in a parking lot. Objects detected: person (95%), car (88%). Safety alerts: Vehicle detected. Be cautious."

3. **Question Answering** (Swipe Right):
   - "Listening... Ask your question now."
